# Ask Market Data Service

## Overview

The Ask Market Data service is a REST API designed to seamlessly interpret and respond to queries about stock market data in natural language. The service is built on the Flask web framework and is equipped to be deployed locally or in a cloud environment, with enhanced support for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) where it was tested.

## Data

This API utilizes a sample End of Day (EOD) market data dataset for the Nasdaq-100 stocks. It includes key trading information such as trading volume, opening, closing, high, and low prices for each stock at the close of the trading day. The data format is as follows:

```text
date, symbol, volume, low, high, open, close, last
2023-05-30, AAPL, 55964401, 176.57, 178.99, 176.96, 177.3, 177.3
```

You are responsible for providing your dataset and modifying the `business_logic.py` module to work with your specific EOD market data.

## Natural Language Interface Design

To handle and interpret queries, this service leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. As such, the implementation of an appropriate NLP model or service within the `business_logic.py` module is essential for the functional transformation of natural language queries into actionable data responses.

### Customization Note

The `business_logic.py` file provided is a skeleton that requires the integration of an NLP service or library. It is recommended to use a modern NLP framework capable of understanding complex queries and fetching relevant market data.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the setup, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.11 or higher.
- Flask 1.1.2 or higher.
- Docker, if you wish to containerize the application.
- pip, for installing Python dependencies.

### Local Environment

To run the application locally, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
FLASK_APP=main.py flask run
```

### Docker Containerization

For those preferring Docker, you can containerize the application by following these steps:

1. To build the Docker image, run:

    ```bash
    docker build -t marketdataquery .
    ```

2. To run the container, execute:

    ```bash
    docker run -e PORT=8080 -p 5000:8080 marketdataquery
    ```

The service should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Google Cloud Run Deployment

VSCode extension [Cloud Code for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GoogleCloudTools.cloudcode) makes the deployment of the containerized Ask Market Data Service as Serverless Cloud Run service on GCP almost trivial.

1. Learn more about Cloud Code for VS Code at [cloud.google.com/code/docs/vscode/cloud-run-overview](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/vscode/cloud-run-overview)

2. Test drive our Cloud Run service deployed at [Ask Market Data API](https://ask-market-data-api-4e6gjgrfea-uc.a.run.app).

## Usage

### API Endpoint

Make a POST request to the following endpoint to use the service:

```text
POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/marketdataquery
```

#### Request Format

Your POST request should include the natural language query in JSON format:

```json
{
    "query": "What is the volume for AAPL?"
}
```

#### Response Format

The service will return the market data requested in the following JSON structure:

```json
{
    "response_id": "uuid",
    "response": "AAPLâ€™s volume is 1.2M shares"
}
```

### Sample Server Log

The verbose output from the web server demonstrates the containerized deployment in action and offers insights into the effectiveness of the ReAct Prompting technique in processing natural language queries. ReAct Prompting, as detailed in [this guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/react), is a method used to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). It involves a series of steps where the LLM 'thinks' through a problem, 'acts' by executing a task, and 'observes' the result before forming a final answer.

There are multiple ReAct Prompting techniques; this app uses the [Langchain Zero-shot ReAct Agent](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/react) to understand both user intents and CSV file data, and to process market data queries efficiently:

```bash

```

These logs showcase the application's capability to parse and execute complex queries about stock market data using a conversational, intuitive approach. This not only enhances the user experience but also demonstrates the power of combining modern NLP techniques with practical applications.

## Future Directions and Collaboration

The Ask Market Data Service exemplifies the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in transforming data analysis. By bringing Generative AI into the realm of CSV and Excel data, this project is just the *beginning* of a broader journey to revolutionize how we interact with data.

My primary focus is on bridging Generative AI with corporate databases, facilitating SQL query generation and translating results back into plain language. The advancement in LLM technologies can empower users from varied backgrounds to interact with structured datasets through simple, natural language, transcending the traditional barriers of technical expertise:

[![Langchain SQL Agent](assets/sql_usecase.png)](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/toolkits/sql_database)

This endeavor is about more than just creating a tool; it's about opening a gateway to intuitive and accessible data interactions for a wider audience. It's a step towards making data-driven decisions more accessible, reducing the need for specialized SQL knowledge and harnessing technology to democratize data analysis.

As we venture into this new territory, I acknowledge that the journey of turning Proof of Concepts (POCs) into production-ready offerings is still nascent. Much like the early days of internet applications, many Generative AI solutions face challenges with speed, cost, consistency, and security. However, these challenges only fuel my commitment to innovation and improvement.

I warmly invite collaborations from individuals and organizations passionate about the intersection of Generative AI, Data, and User Experience. Let's combine our learnings, experiences, and imagination to push the boundaries of what's possible, crafting solutions that are not only technologically advanced but also secure, efficient, and user-centric.

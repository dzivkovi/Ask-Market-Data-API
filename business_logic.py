This module contains the business logic for a Flask application that serves as a greeting service
and a market data query service. It includes functions to create a personalized greeting and to
process natural language market data queries.

Note:
- Business logic for greeting and market data queries goes in here.
- To start Flask app from the command line, run:
    python -m flask run --port 5000
